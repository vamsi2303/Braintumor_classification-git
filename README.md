# Braintumor_classification-git

Braintumor_classification classifies whether the Brain MRI has tumor or not.
If the Brain MRI has tumor then it further detects which type of tumor it is.

There are three main types of tumor
1.Benign 
2.Premalignant.
3.Malignant. Only malignant tumors are cancerous.

Here we are using a CNN algorithm i.e Resnet50 to classify the type of tumor.
